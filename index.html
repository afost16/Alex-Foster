                <p>Hi! I am a qualitative researcher at the<a
                        href="https://r-house.luddy.indiana.edu/researchers/index.html" target="_blank"> R-House
                        Robotics Lab</a> and incoming Master's student at the University of Washington's <a
                        href="https://www.hcde.washington.edu/">Human-Centered
                        Design & Engineering program</a>.
                </p>

                <p>I recently graduated with my Bachelor's in Informatics with a focus in Human-Computer Interaction at
                    <a href="https://bloomington.iu.edu/">Indiana University</a>.
                    My research in human-robot interaction
                    (HRI) and human-computer interaction (HCI) has helped researchers better conduct
                    research for people living with dementia and their carepartners. I am particularly interested in studying
                    communities and subcultures like these that need attention in this digital era. Ultimately, I want
                    to develop timeless
                    systems and methods that serve as counterbalances to
                    rapid technological advancement so people can live healthier lives with technology.
                </p>

                <p> I am currently working on a project to detect changes in speech for people living with dementia and
                    mild
                    cognitive
                    impairment using a conversational robot at the <a
                        href="https://r-house.luddy.indiana.edu/researchers/index.html" target="_blank"> R-House
                        Robotics Lab</a>, in collaboration with researchers
                    at
                    DePaul University. When I'm not researching or doing schoolwork, I enjoy weightlifting,
                    bouldering, cooking
                    vegan food,
                    and
                    watching my favorite soccer team, Manchester United.</p>
